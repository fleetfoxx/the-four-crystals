# How to spice up the boss battle prototype?
- Boss phases
- Additional enemies/minions
- âœ… The trees are enemies that attack you and drop sticks if hit with the boomerang
  - Trees only chase you if you're carrying a stick.
- Random chance of beehives to drop out of trees. Run to water to shake them off

# Boss prototype ideas
- spider that spins web around arena, player must lead spider in order to take advantage of the web in some way
  - sneak to catch bugs and use them to bait the spider through a cave
- blind monster that reacts to sound, trick the boss into injuring itself using sound

# Mechanic prototype ideas
- sneak/stealth (reduce noise and visibility)
  - Disguise self as plant/animal/monster/last thing you touched? to act as camouflage
  - environmental sounds
